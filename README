ArangoDB

ArangoDB is a universal open-source database with flexible data model for
documents, graphs, and key-values. Build high performance application using a
convenient sql-like query language or JavaScript/Ruby extensions.
Key features include:

* Schema-free schemata let you combine the space efficiency of MySQL with the
  performance power of NoSQL
* Use ArangoDB as an application server and fuse your application and database
  together for maximal throughput
* JavaScript for all: no language zoo, you can use one language from your
  browser to your back-end
* ArangoDB is multi-threaded - exploit the power of all your cores
* Flexible data modeling: model your data as combination of key-value pairs,
  documents or graphs - perfect for social relations
* Free index choice: use the correct index for your problem, be it a skip list
  or a n-gram search
* Configurable durability: let the application decide if it needs more
  durability or more performance
* No-nonsense storage: ArangoDB uses all of the power of modern storage
  hardware, like SSD and large caches
* Powerful query language (AQL) to retrieve data
* It is open source (Apache Licence 2.0)

For the Impatient

For Mac OSX execute

  brew install arangodb

For Linux use the distribution dependend package manager, see Installation
Manual for details.
For Windows users: We provide an installer script on our download_page.
If the package manager has not already started the ArangoDB server, use

  unix> /path/to/sbin/arangod

  business

/path/to/sbin is OS dependent. It will normally by either /usr/sbin or /user/
local/sbin. Point your browser to

  http://localhost:8529/

and select the tab Shell. You can now use the Arango shell from within your
browser. Alternative, it is available as command-line tool arangosh.

  arangosh> db._create("hallo");
  arangosh> db.hallo.save({ world: "earth" });

Congratulations! You have created your first collection called hallo and your
first document. To verify your achievements

  arangosh> db.hallo.toArray();
